Core Site
==============================================================================

A very small web framework to make php coding easier. When I was annoyed about
PHPs "disabilities" last weekend, I wrote this little framework. It's useful
when you need to make a little service on a host where no python is available.

## Requirements

PHP 5.3.1 was used but it may work with 5.*, too.

## How to install

The `site` folder is your website or project. Copy it to your devolpment or production server. Now edit the `settings.php` file and configure the project.

To create an application, add a new folder inside the `site` folder or edit
the example app.
